# Screen Loader Animation 

It's a simple animation where it will be executed every time the user enters the page.

**No frameworks** have been used, and **no server** is required.

## Programming languages:
* **HTML**
* **CSS**
* **JS**

## How it works
The files in `/` contain the animation,  when the animation ends, it will display the content inside the directory `/main_content`

## Animation
<div align="center">
<img src="assets/Web_Screen_Loader_Animation.gif" width="500">
</div>
